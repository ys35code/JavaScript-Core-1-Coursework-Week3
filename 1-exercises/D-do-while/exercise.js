/*
    Sometimes when using loops, we'll want to execute the body of the loop at least once. We can make sure this happens by using a do-while loop.
        - If the condition in a while loop is initially false, the body of the loop will never execute
        - But in a do-while loop, because the condition is checked after the body, we know that it will always execute at least once
    
    Using a do-while loop, write a function which returns the sum of the first n even numbers (starting from 0)
*/

function evenNumbersSum(n) {
  let sum = 0;
  let i = 0;
  let y = 1;
  do {
    if (i % 2 === 0) {
      sum = sum + i;
      y++;
    }
    i++;
  } while (y <= n);
  return sum;
}

console.log(evenNumbersSum(3)); // should output 6
console.log(evenNumbersSum(0)); // should output 0
console.log(evenNumbersSum(10)); // should output 90
